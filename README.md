# `@impetus-js`

## About
`@impetus-js` (no relation to the company Impetus) is my organization for all the tools that I build that are primarily for myself and to show off interesting code. I guess one could say that I'm working on problems that I find interesting. For instance I don't have an interest in consistently configuring a website or setting up my `eslint` rules. I hope to add some VSCode custom plugins (depending on complexity). Many of these projects are intended for personal use but will be published to `npm` if I deem them useful enough.

PRs always welcome for new features or bug fixes as I won't be fulfilling feature requests.

## Note
Primarily to showcase (PoC/simple) architecture patterns that are useful and should, hopefully, give others examples on how to build out code and application in JavaScript or TypeScript. The code in here is for personal use, primarily, so please do not try to use for production.
